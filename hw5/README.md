## How to run

* Use the makefile to compile and run the driver file
  * To run the makefile, execute `$make run` in the makefile's directory (or simply type `$make` to compile but not run)
  * Put input file (in1.txt) in the same directory as the driver file before running
    * Also please make sure there are no blank lines between test cases
