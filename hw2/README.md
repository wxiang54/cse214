## How to run

* There is a folder for each question in the zipped folder
* Inside each questions' folder are the respective .java files, along with a makefile to compile and run the driver file
  * To run the makefile, execute `$make run` in the makefile's directory (or simply type `$make` to compile but not run)
  * For some questions, there is a q<#>src package to store my data struct implementations and keep them seperate from the driver file
  * Make sure the input files are in the same directory as the driver file before running
    * Also please make sure there are no blank lines between test cases in input files
